# hackathon-portal

Our product goal is to build an application that will serve as a centralization for all facets of Hackathon management with a user base of not only Hackathon organizers but all Hackathon participants: volunteers, hackers, sponsors, etc. At its base (i.e. the minimum viable product), it will serve as a primarily web-based platform to connect organizers and sponsors/mentors on a unified system, and display the publicly facing information like prize categories and workshop times to hackers. While the initial goal is to target this towards GrizzHacks as 80% of the team is involved, our hope is to design this platform in such a way that other hackathon teams can stand up and use this platform as well. In addition, this project will be built with both a distributed architecture and modular system, so that it can be maintained by multiple groups of GrizzHacks organizers for years to come, and hopefully be open sourced so that other teams can use it as well. Once the MVP is completed, we hope to expand out into more features as time permits during the semester and over the summer before MLH Hackcon and GrizzHacks 6.
